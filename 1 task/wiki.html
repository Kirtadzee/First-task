        <p>
            <b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a 
            <strong>website</strong> for the Internet or an <i>intranet</i>. 
            It can range from developing a simple <em>static page</em> of plain text 
            to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network 
            services. Web development may use <mark>content management systems</mark> 
            to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
            Some older methods are <del>no longer used</del> 
            and new ones have been <ins>introduced</ins>. 
            The term “Web” often includes technologies such as HTML<sub>5</sub> 
            and CSS<sup>3</sup>.

        <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and Web development</h2>

        <!-- SUBSECTION 1 -->
        <h3>Origin / Wesb 1.0</h3>
        <p>
            The <b>first generation</b> of the web, known as 
            <strong>Web 1.0</strong>, consisted mainly of static websites. 
            Pages were <i>read-only</i> and users had very limited interaction. 
            Content was created by developers and delivered to users without 
            engagement. Many early features are <del>obsolete</del> now, while 
            some ideas were <ins>improved later</ins>. 
            HyperText Markup Language (HTML<sub>1</sub>) and early scripting 
            technologies were the foundation of this era, before modern 
            JavaScript<sup>ES6</sup> existed.
        </p>

        <!-- SUBSECTION 2 -->
        <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Web 2.0</b> introduced <strong>user-generated content</strong>, 
            social media, and interactive websites. Unlike Web 1.0, this era 
            focused on <i>dynamic content</i> and <em>two-way communication</em>. 
            Platforms allowed users to create, share, and interact. 
            Many old static principles were <del>replaced</del> with 
            <ins>interactive technologies</ins>. 
            Databases and new forms of markup such as HTML<sub>4</sub> and CSS<sup>2</sup> 
            became central.
        </p>

        <!-- SUBSECTION 3 -->
        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Web 3.0</b>, also called the <strong>semantic web</strong>, 
            aims to make data machine-readable and decentralized. 
            It involves <i>AI-driven</i> information, <em>blockchain</em>, and 
            personalized content delivery. Some traditional models were 
            <del>rejected</del> in favor of <ins>distributed systems</ins>. 
            Technologies such as JSON<sub>LD</sub> and advanced algorithms 
            using AI<sup>ML</sup> help create smarter web experiences.
